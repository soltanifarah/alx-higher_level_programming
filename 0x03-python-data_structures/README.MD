Introduction
This project explores various tasks related to Python programming, focusing on data structures and algorithms. The tasks include functions for manipulating lists, working with strings, and solving a problem related to linked lists.
List of Files
0-print_list_integer.py: Prints all integers in a list.

1-element_at.py: Retrieves an element from a list at a specific index.

2-replace_in_list.py: Replaces an element in a list at a specific position.

3-print_reversed_list_integer.py: Prints all integers of a list in reverse order.

4-new_in_list.py: Replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.

5-no_c.py: Removes all occurrences of 'c' and 'C' from a string.

6-print_matrix_integer.py: Prints a matrix of integers.

7-add_tuple.py: Adds two tuples element-wise.

8-multiple_returns.py: Returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.

9-max_integer.py: Finds the largest integer in a list.

10-divisible_by_2.py: Identifies multiples of 2 in a list.

11-delete_at.py: Deletes an item at a specific position in a list.

12-switch.py: Switches the values of two variables.

13-is_palindrome.c, lists.h: Checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome (C language).

Usage
Each Python file can be executed independently. For the C program, compile it with the provided files (linked_lists.c, 13-is_palindrome.c, lists.h) and run the executable.
